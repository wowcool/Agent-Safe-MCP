## Long Description
Agent Safe is an email safety verification service built for AI agents. Before your agent responds to, forwards, or acts on any email, Agent Safe analyzes it across six threat categories: phishing, prompt injection, CEO fraud, social engineering, financial fraud, and data exfiltration.

The service returns a clear verdict (safe/suspicious/dangerous), a risk score from 0.0 to 1.0, a list of detected threats, a detailed analysis, and a recommended action (proceed/verify/block).

Agents are first-class customers. No human registration required. Agents connect directly via MCP Streamable HTTP transport and pay per use through Skyfire Network PAY tokens at $0.02 per email check.

Powered by Anthropic Claude for deep contextual email analysis. Part of the Anti-Deepfake/Agent Abuse protection suite by LocationLedger.
